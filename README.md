# ML-UseCase-Canvas
An adapted ML canvas for the integration of use cases in ML requirements analysis. This Cansas is based on: "Machine Learning Canvas" from the author Louis Dorard from 2015 and can be originally found under: "https://www.machinelearningcanvas.com".

This ML-UseCase-Canvas was developed as part of a potential analysis method to identify potential applications for machine learning in organizations. The method will be presented at INFORMAIK 2024 in Wiesbaden in September 2024 and will be published in the paper: "Eine Methode für die Potenzialanalyse zur Identifikation von Anwendungsszenarien für Maschinelles Lernen" after the conference. A link to the paper will be provided after publishing.

This ML-UseCase-Canvas was developed as part of the collaborative project [simplex4learning](www.simplex4learning.de) (“Intelligent environmental data analysis through automated machine learning for domain users”). Simplex4learning project is sponsored by Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the "KMU-innovativ IKT" funding program under the funding code 01IS23041A-C.
